# LocQ - Implementation of LinQ with TDD

## Introduction

I knew about TDD (Test Driven Development) for a long time ago, however I haven't tried it yet.
Understand it as a development way which start writing the test before detail implementation.

In this repo, I would like to givea it a try that implement LinQ manually in TDD way. This is a the best time for me to understand more about LinQ and practice TDD.

## TDD (Test driven development)

### What is TDD?

Test driven development is a software development practice that require developer to write the test cases before detail implementation.

Based on the requirements, developer will know exactly expectation their function should return. So that they can write a test first then refactoring their code to adapt the test cases.
